# Multiscale_mechanobiology_GR
Multiscale modeling of cardiovascular disease growth coupling organ-scale mechanics and cell-scale biology

This software contains the instructions and input files needed to reproduce 3 different growth and remodeling phenomena within FEniCS. Here, we couple organ-scale and cell signaling pathways. 

You can find the tutorial for the software here:

Simulations of growth and remodeling for the cube, aneurysm and aortic valve cases are contained here. 

The geometries for the cube and aneurysm models are created within the FEniCS input files. The geometry for the aortic valve can be downloaded at:
