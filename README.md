# Multiscale_mechanobiology_GR
Multiscale modeling of cardiovascular disease growth coupling organ-scale mechanics and cell-scale biology

This software contains the instructions and input files needed to reproduce different growth and remodeling phenomena within FEniCS. Here, we couple organ-scale and cell signaling pathways. 

The instructions to reproduce the problems in FEniCS are available here:

Simulations of growth and remodeling for the cube, aneurysm and aortic valve cases are contained in this repository.
